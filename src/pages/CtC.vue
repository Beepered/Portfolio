        <p>I am working as the producer for my college capstone final project. You play as a robber, breaking into
            buildings to steal items and sell them to buy upgrades. I work on system design, 2D art, trailers, and
            team management.</p>

        <h3>Quarter 1: Scaffolding</h3>
        <p>I designed the interaction
            system and UI, while my group worked on the AI pathfinding, sounds, and getting assets.
            We realized that we didn't have anything to show off so we
            began designing a central level, which helped us see how our ideas working in a plausible level.
        </p>

        <h3>Quarter 2: Level generation and level selection</h3>
        <p>I onboarded new members,
            refactored systems, and focused on new levels. We switched from having a pre-designed level to making
            randomly generated ones as it would help lengthen game time. I kept checking in with members every few
            days, offered help, and cleaned up code.
        </p>

        <h3>Current: Limbo</h3>
        <p>Most of the team has
            left or gotten jobs. I enjoyed working on this while the group was still together, but it was been hard
            getting
            time to work on it and encouraging the group while we still had other classes to worry about. This project
            has tested my leadership skills, programming, and time management. Great experience!
        </p>
        <p>We are stuck on a big level generation bug, but no one has time to fix it. Hopefully the game gets released
            at some point.</p>
